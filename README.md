# Portfolio Project

In this project, A delivery company has to deliver packages to several buildings in a city. Given the set of buildings and the distance between every pair of buildings, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every building exactly once and returns to the starting building.
Implement a function that takes a list of buildings and a starting building and returns the shortest possible route to travel from the starting building to all the other buildings, visiting all the buildings exactly once and returning to the starting building
